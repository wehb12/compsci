TO DO:

1. [x] Create a strategy generator
  1.1 [ ] Make it lense nonesenical
    1.1.1 [ ] If two exit keywords appear in a row, then stop generating (one if no 'IF' statement)
    1.1.2 [ ] Reduce probability of putting in a number, they look weird.
    1.1.3 [ ] Reduce probability of '+' and '-' operators
    1.1.4 [ ] New way of generation seed.
    1.1.5 [ ] IF LAST = Z GOTO... followed by IF LAST = Z GOTO... is silly, stop this from happening
  1.2 [x] Make it object oriented
  1.3 [ ] Add in ITERATIONS and MYSCORE variables - change when flags [8] and [9] trigger when you do this
2. [ ] Read in strategies - store words from file as a 2D matrix of strings?
